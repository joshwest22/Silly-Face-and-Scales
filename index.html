<h2>What is scale? How is it used?</h2>    
<span>In a basic sense scale does what the name implies in that it adjusts the current drawing bigger or smaller. It is important to note that if you scale a drawing once it will keep that scaling for any future drawings created. </span>
<br />
<span>Using the scale method is simple. When doing so, simply say the name of a visual element on a canvas (e.g. a rectangle variable called myRect) and then .scale(.5,.5) (e.g. myRect.scale(.5,.5) which would draw myRect at half of its original size). It is entirely possible to use numbers over 100% with scale for example myRect.scale(2,2) would double the rectangle size without any issues. Scale will be useful for adjusting the size of images and svgs in the future.</span>
